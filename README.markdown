Welcome to Loreia's UDL project
===============================

**UDL** stands for **U**ser **D**efined **L**anguage.  
It is a feature of [Notepad++](http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/) editor through which users can define their own syntax highlighting.

This is my own copy of Notepad++ source code that is hosted at [official SVN repo](svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/notepadplus/repository).  
Periodic synchronization is done with help of [svn2git](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git) utility.


UDL and UDL2
------------
This feature was developed under the name _UDL2_ to distinguish it from official _UDL_, and was later integrated into Notepad++ master branch starting with Notepad++ version 6.2 (svn rev. XXX). Since then this project has been be renamed simply to UDL (as there is just one UDL again). I also decided to create new git repository for new UDL project. It is based on latest beta from old UDL2 repo, but it doesn't have the history of UDL2:

    svn repo:    5.9.3 --> 5.9.4 -->  ... rest of the Notepad++ project
                   |
    UDL branch:    --> initial commit (last beta from UDL2 repo) --> ... rest of the UDL project

Git repository organization
---------------------------
*master branch* - is generated by [svn2git](https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git) utility and is a mirror of [official SVN repository](svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/notepadplus/repository)   
*develop branch* - is where UDL development is taking place   
*public branch* - is where UDL releases are stored (e.g. v2.0, v2.1 and so on)   
*release, hotfix and feature branches* are temporary and will be merged with *master* and *develop* branches.   
Details can be found on [successful-git-branching-model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) page.

Documentation
-------------
Temporary [documentation site](http://udl20.weebly.com/) was created during initial development, but site has rarely been upadated. My plan is to create completely new documentation site. In the mean time if something is not clear the best place to get help would be to ask on official [Notepad++ forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/notepad-plus/discussion/).


Thank you and best regards,  
Loreia
